      "I'm a Senior Product Designer at Trello, which is part of the Atlassian ecosystem. I work remotely here in Indianapolis from my home that I share with my wife (also named Anna), 2 sons, and a multitude of dogs and cats. My first passion in my career was public health education, specifically HIV/AIDS education and outreach, which led me to getting a B.S. in Public Health with minors in Spanish and Human Sexuality at IU Bloomington. A job at the campus computer support center ignited my interest in finding creative ways to help people use technology to make their lives better. Through a series of fortunate events, I found my way to a Health Informatics class, which combined my love of the health field and technology, and also introduced me to the Human-Computer Interaction/design (HCI/d) master's program at IU Bloomington. Since completing my M.S. in HCI/d in 2012, I've held a number of positions as an in-house UX/Product Designer at multiple tech/SaaS companies in Indianapolis, including Blackbaud, Salesforce, and Springbuk, with a short stint in freelancing. Much of my experience has focused on enterprise-level products, designing for more complex experiences across large-scale companies. ",
